# Trip Planning



In this project, I Built a park recommendation system for vacation planning. I scaped 1000+ parks(amusement parks, national parks, state parks etc.) and 1.3 user reviews from tripadvisor.com 

The parks are clustered based on reviews using dimension reduction SVD and kmeans, where T-SNE is used for visualizing clusters.

Recommended parks are retrieved featuring userâ€™s preference of theme, season, popularity, and visitor types. Parks' features are highlighted using the words extracted from reviews.
